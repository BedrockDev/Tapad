# Tapad
### Remixing X Material Design

***Probably the best looking remix app out there.***

*This is not an ordinary LaunchPad app, it's Tapad.*

## Material Design

The user interface follows most of the Material Design guidelines from Google. We develop Tapad with the highest priority on the experience you get. The butter-like experience is best on phones running Android Lollipop and above.

## Remix for everyone

Select preset, select deck, play! No more complicated settings and disturbing experiences.

## Customizability

Change the color you play, the color you see. Adding your sounds and patterns will be added soon!

## Know about artist

Tapad informs you about the artist of the song which you are playing. Show them love and support!

## Featuring
