### Remixing X Material Design

***Probably the best looking remix app out there.***

*This is not an ordinary LaunchPad app, it's Tapad.*

#### Material Design

The user interface follows most of the Material Design guidelines from Google. We develop Tapad with the highest priority on the experience you get. The butter-like experience is best on phones running Android Lollipop and above.

#### Remix for everyone

Select preset, select deck, play! No more complicated settings and disturbing experiences.

#### Customizability

Change the color you play, the color you see. Adding your sounds and patterns will be added soon!

#### Know about artist

Tapad informs you about the artist of the song which you are playing. Show them love and support!

#### Featuring

• OMFG - Hello (Needs gesture fix)

• The Chainsmokers - Roses (Needs fix)

• Faded - Alan Walker (Needs vocal updates)

• Marshmello - Alone (On work)

• More songs coming soon!

#### Communicate with Devs

E-mail with dev, request songs and features. Play your favorite song on Tapad!
